# Intro to Programming

## Objective
The objective of this course is to give people with no prior software development experience an introduction to programming and thinking about data. 

Primarily this is achieved by teaching programming concepts with JavaScript and Python and data concepts with SQL in spreadsheets. We also focus on professional development skills such as communicating effectively and working well on a team.

A pre-requisite of this module is having completed Hack Your Futureâ€™s Intro to Digital module which teaches the basics of HTML and CSS.
