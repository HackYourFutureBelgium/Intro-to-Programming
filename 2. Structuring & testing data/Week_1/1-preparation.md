## ü§ù Interacting with computers

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define a computer

Modern computers are complicated: it would be too difficult and time-consuming to list all the components that make up a modern computer. So to build our mental model, we will use this simple definition of a computer:

A `computer` is a device used to store and perform operations on data.

## üïπÔ∏è Using an interface

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Categorize different interfaces

We want to use computers without understanding exactly how they are built. Every day we ask machines to do things, and usually we have no idea how these machines work. We could not use modern technology if we had to understand it completely before we could use it; it would take too long! Instead we use interfaces(Think of an interface as a gate that allows communication between a user and a machine. The user asks the machine to do things via the interface.). 

Think about a cash machine (ATM). We go to a hole in the wall with a screen and a keypad. The `screen` and the `keypad` are the user interface. We press the buttons and ask the machine to do things - like giving our balance, or withdrawing some money from an account. We don‚Äôt need to understand how the information it tells us comes on the screen.

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Exercise
Define the user interface for these devices:

A calculator <br> A microwave <br> A desktop lamp <br> Facebook <br> Alexa <br> ChatGPT

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal interface

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Identify the terminal and its purpose
- [ ] Execute commands in the terminal

Programmers need interfaces to ask computers to do things. A computer terminal is an interface where programmers can issue commands to a computer. Because users enter text instructions and receive text output, we say that the terminal is a text-based interface.

Open Your Terminal <br> Interface via the terminal <br> We can input a command into the prompt and hit enter. The terminal then passes this command to the computer to execute. Find your own terminal and input the ls command:

`ls`

#### The terminal is a window on the computer, prompting users for instructions.

### üñäÔ∏è Writing computer instructions

We can issue commands to the computer using the terminal. These commands are instructions that the computer knows how to interpret.

The computer knows `ls` means ‚Äúlist the files and directories in the current directory‚Äù.

During the execution of a computer program, a computer will store and modify data(Data is information. Text, images, numbers are all forms of data). 

The data in an executing program is sometimes called the state. A computer program will modify data with operations(Operations modify or create data, from the current data in the program. Adding numbers, joining words, changing text to ALLCAPS, are all operations).

`ls` is a shell command. Shell is a programming language we use to interact with the files and folders on our computer. You already know at least two more programming languages. Can you name them?

### üìñ Definition: programming language

A `programming language` is a limited set of rules for writing computer instructions.

## üóÑÔ∏è Classifying data

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define data type, expression, and operator

We‚Äôre going to focus on the JavaScript programming language.

A programming language organizes data with rules so we understand what we can and cannot do with it. Languages split data up into different categories called data types(
A data type is a grouping of data with some particular properties). <br> In JavaScript, we have five data types. We will look first at numbers and strings.

Number data type <br>
`10` is an example of the number data type. `3.14` is also part of the number data type; both integers (whole numbers) and non-integers are types of number. <br>

`-15` is also part of the number data type. Positive and negative numbers, as well as `0`, are all types of number.

String data type
A string is a sequence of characters demarcated by quotes.<br>
```js
"Hack your Future";
```

#### Creating expressions

Think of the numbers `10` and `32`. We could ask questions about these numbers, like: What is the sum of 10 and 32?<br>

Another way to say this is what do 10 and 32 add up to? In English we can say this in many ways, but in JavaScript we can say this using numbers and an operator. Just like in mathematics, ‚Äúthe sum of 10 and 32‚Äù can be written as 10 + 32:

```js
10 + 32;
````

In JavaScript, `+` is an operator(
An operator represents an operation, or act). It‚Äôs a symbol. In this example, `+` represents the operation `‚Äúmake the sum of the numbers‚Äù.` It symbolizes addition. <br>

The combination of symbols `10` `+` `32` is an expression`(An expression is a value or any valid combination of values and symbols that results in a single value)`. We say that expressions evaluate to a single value. So we say that `10 + 32` evaluates to the value `42`.

`10` is also an expression. It evaluates to the value `10`.

`"Hack Your Future"` and `"Hack Your " + "Future"` are also both expressions - both evaluate to the value `"Hack Your Future"`.

## üßæ Evaluating expressions

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define the features of the Node REPL
- [ ] Evaluate expressions using your mental model of JavaScript
- [ ] Evaluate expressions using the Node REPL

### üí°Tip

```js
Computers work by storing and performing operations on data.
````

Computer programs are built from many expressions. We must understand how expressions are evaluated to understand how computer programs are executed.

We can take an expression like `36 * 45` and ask what it evaluates to. If we know what the `*` operator represents (multiplication) and if we understand the arithmetic rules represented by the operation we can evaluate this expression ourselves.

Happily, computers can evaluate expressions for us.

NodeJS is an application that runs JavaScript programs. In other words, NodeJS can understand and execute programs written in JavaScript. One feature of Node is the REPL.

### üìù Note
REPL is a special type of program that stands for: <br>

Read - Users enter some code that Node will read <br>
Evaluate - Node will then evaluate this code <br>
Print - Node will print the result to the terminal <br>
Loop - Node will loop back to the beginning and prompt users to input some more code
With a REPL we can run pieces of code and look at what happens.

We input JavaScript instructions that are then executed by NodeJS. The REPL replies with, or prints out, the result of this execution.

### REPL Activity Code

Type each of the following expressions into the REPL one at a time and then press enter to check the result.

```js
10 + 32;
```

```js
32 / 10;
```

### Step-by-Step

##### üïπÔ∏èActivity

1. Open the terminal on your computer
2. Check you‚Äôve got Node installed on your computer
3. Start the Node REPL in your terminal
4. Enter the expressions and evaluate them using the Node REPL

If you don‚Äôt know how to do any of the steps above, then try searching for an [appropriate command](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-use-the-nodejs-repl) online. Searching for things when you‚Äôre stuck is super important part of being a developer!

### Explore REPL

##### üïπÔ∏èActivity

Create your own expressions and enter them into the Node REPL.

üß† Before you type in the expressions, predict what the REPL output will be. Write your prediction down and compare it to the outcome.

## üìÇ Prep dir

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Create a working prep directory for the module

1. [Fork the coursework module]() and open it in VSCode.
2. In your VSCode terminal, navigate to the root of your project directory.
3. Create a new directory called `prep` to store all the files you‚Äôll be working on for this module.

As you work through the module, you‚Äôll be creating files in this directory to code along with the prep content. You are expected to code along with the prep content.

For simple one liners, use the terminal REPL to run the code. For more complex problems, create files in the `prep` directory and write the code there. Make commented notes as you go along explaining why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing. Your future self will thank you.

### üîë The most important thing is to secure your understanding

The prep content is designed to help you understand the concepts you‚Äôll be working with in the module. Don‚Äôt just read it, code along with it. Also take notes, draw diagrams, pose your own questions and try to answer them.

To really understand programming, you need to write the code yourself, and do the exercises. You must [take active part](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1319030111) in your learning to succeed.

## üè∑Ô∏è Variables

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Identify the syntactic features of a variable declaration
- [ ] Explain why we use variable declarations
- [ ] Create strings using variables and template literals

In programming we often want to reuse our work. Consider the string: `"Hello there"`

Suppose we want to create different greetings for different people, like: `"Hello there, Alicia" "Hello there, Barny"`

We can use a variable to store this string and reuse it. How can we create a variable?

üè∑Ô∏è Variable <br> A variable is a label for a piece of data. We assign a piece of data to a label and then refer back to this label, in place of the data.

We can create a variable in our program by writing a variable declaration.

üß∂ Declaration <br> A declaration is an instruction that binds an identifier to a value. , like this:
```js
const greeting = "Hello there";
```

Break down the different syntactic elements of this variable declaration:

- `const` is a keyword used to indicate we‚Äôre creating a variable.
- `greeting` is the identifier - it can be used to refer to a variable after it has been declared.
- `=` is the assignment operator. It means assign to the label greeting the value of the expression on the right hand side. 
- `"Hello there"` - this is the expression whose value we‚Äôre assigning to the label greeting.

### Try it yourself

Type this variable declaration into the REPL:
```js
const greeting = "Hello there";
```

Now refer to the label greeting in the REPL:
```js
`${greeting}, Alicia`
```

Our greeting variable is stored in memory. We can reuse it to build more expressions:
```js
`${greeting}, Barny`
```

We just used backticks to create a template literal.
```js
`A template literal places ${expressions} inside strings;
```

With template literals, we can insert expressions into strings to produce new strings. Any time we want to reference a variable inside a template literal we use a dollar sign $ and a set of curly braces {}. We can put any expression (e.g. a variable name) inside the curly braces. The value that expression evaluates to is then placed inside the string.

When an operation uses an expression, that expression is immediately evaluated, and how it was written is forgotten about. That means that the greetAlicia variable is the same in all three of these cases:
```js
const greetAlicia = "Hello there, Alicia";
```

üìù string literal
In this example, we don‚Äôt use a variable or a template to create a string. Instead we write a string "Hello there, Alicia".

A sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks is called a string literal. "Hello there, Alicia" is a string literal.

Similarly, 10 is a number literal.

```js
const name = "Alicia";
const greetAlicia = `Hello there, ${name}`;
```

```js
const greeting = "Hello there";
const name = "Alicia";
const greetAlicia = `${greeting}, ${name}`;
```
The greetAlicia variable doesn‚Äôt remember whether you used variables to make it or not - in all three cases, greetAlicia contains the string "Hello there, Alicia". Once a value is made, it doesn‚Äôt matter how it was made.

## üí¨ Declarations and statements

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define a declaration
- [ ] Define a statement
- [ ] Describe the difference between a declaration and a statement
- [ ] Describe the difference between let and const

A variable declaration is an example of a declaration(A declaration is an instruction that binds an identifier to a value). It has the effect of creating a variable.
```js
let versionNumber = "2.0.0"; // declaration
versionNumber = "2.0.1"; // statement
```
The code above has one variable declaration and one statement.

1. The first line is a declaration - creating a variable `versionNumber` with a value of "2.0.0".
2. The second line is a statement - reassignment (Reassignment means changing the value associated with an identifier.) of the value of `versionNumber` to "2.0.1".

In this example, we‚Äôve used the `let` keyword to declare a new variable. The `let` keyword allows us to create new variables like the `const` keyword.

However, we can reassign the value of a variable that is declared with the `let` keyword.

If we‚Äôd used `const` to declare `versionNumber`, we wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to reassign it a new value.

In JavaScript, we build up programs by combining declarations and statements.

## ü™Ñ Functions

#### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define a function in programming
- [ ] Evaluate a function expression
- [ ] Call a function with an input in REPL

Now, instead of adding or multiplying numbers, we‚Äôll consider `10.3`.

ü§î ‚ÄúWhat is the nearest whole number to `10.3`?‚Äù

The process of finding the nearest whole number to a decimal number is called `rounding`. So we could rephrase our question as:

ü§î ‚ÄúWhat does the number 10.3 round to?‚Äù

‚ôªÔ∏è Reusing instructions
There is no operator for rounding the number 10.3 in JavaScript. But we will want to round numbers again and again. We should use a function (A function is a reusable set of instructions.)

`Math.round` is a function. Because a function is a reusable set of instructions, `Math.round` rounds any number.

Functions usually take inputs and then apply their set of instructions to the inputs to produce an output.

#### Try it yourself

1. Write `Math.round` in the Node REPL
2. Hit enter to evaluate our expression

The REPL output [Function: round] is telling us Math.round is a function.

### üì≤ Calling a function

For our function to work, we need Node to read the instructions and execute(
Execution means the computer reads and follows instructions) them. Write the following in the REPL:

```js
Math.round(10.3);
```

Notice the `'('` and `')'` parenthesis after the name of the function and a number inside the brackets. These parenthesis mean we are calling the function. The number inside the brackets is the input we‚Äôre passing to the function.

üìù Calling a function <br>
Calling a function means telling the computer to read the function‚Äôs instructions and carry out its instructions. When calling a function we can also pass inputs to the function.

`Math.round(10.3)` is a call expression; read this as:

‚Äúapply the set of instructions for Math.round to the number 10.3.‚Äù

If we type Math.round(10.3) then we get the result 10. So we say that Math.round(10.3) returns 10.

A call expression is an expression which evaluates to the value returned by the function when it is called. So the expression Math.round(10.3) evaluates to the value 10.

If we assign that expression to a variable, or use it in a string, we‚Äôll get the value 10. So we can write:

```js
const roundedValue = Math.round(10.3);
```

or we can write:

```js
const roundedValueInAString = `10.3 rounds to ${Math.round(10.3)}`;
```

Both of these instructions evaluate the call expression Math.round(10.3) to the returned value 10 as soon as the call expression appears. The variable roundedValue will have a numeric value 10 (just like if we‚Äôd written const roundedValue = 10;), and the variable roundedValueInAString will have a string value "10.3 rounds to 10".

## üìÅ Running scripts

#### Learning objectives 
- [ ] Execute a JavaScript file with Node

So far we‚Äôve seen how expressions can be evaluated using the Node REPL. The Node REPL is useful for evaluating expressions quickly.

But usually, our programs have many instructions, and we want to keep and re-run them instead of typing them out each time. So we save our instructions in files. Node can also execute instructions written in a file.

We use the node command to run a JavaScript file in the terminal. A JavaScript file ends with .js - this is the ‚Äúfile extension‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs suppose we have a file age.js. We run the command node age.js. This terminal command is an instruction to execute the program written inside age.js. Our program has five lines. So the computer will read and execute the program one line at a time:

```js
const yearOfBirth = 1990; // declaration
let currentYear = 2023; // declaration

currentYear++; // statement
`I am ${currentYear - yearOfBirth} years old`; // statement
```

üïπÔ∏è Activity

Check you can run a file with Node:
1. In your terminal, create a new file called example.js.
2. Try writing a few lines in the file.
3. Get Node to run this file. (Don‚Äôt use the REPL now - you should run a command to execute the whole file.)

Once the computer executes these statements, the execution of the program is complete. But we‚Äôre left with a problem. With the REPL, when the user inputs an expression statement or declaration, the computer reads and executes the line and immediately prints feedback to the terminal. With a file, the computer will execute each line sequentially until completion without printing the values of each expression it evaluates.

So this new problem can be expressed as a question:

‚ùì Problem

‚ÄúHow can we check what the values evaluated to in our program during execution?‚Äù

## üñ®Ô∏è Logging

### Learning objectives

 - [ ] Use console.log to print a value

 Printing to the terminal

To look at values when our program runs, we can use a function called `console.log`.

üí° console.log <br>
Console usually means a text interface like a terminal. A log is a written record of something that happened.

So `console.log` will record something that happens in our program and print it to a text based interface.

console.log logs the result of expressions while our program is executing. This is very useful for complex programs when we need to check what values expressions evaluate to at specific moments of our program execution.

Let‚Äôs see how to use console.log . In a file called example.js, write the name of the function console.log.

```js
console.log;
```

If we run this file with Node, we won‚Äôt be able to see anything in the terminal. As with Math.round we need to use the syntax for calling a function. Add brackets after the function name:

```js
console.log("hello there!");
```

We should see the string `"hello there!"` logged out in the terminal.

### ‚ùå Errors

- [ ] Identify the cause of syntax errors in small snippets of JavaScript
- [ ] Interpret syntax error messages to determine their cause and how to fix them

üó£Ô∏è Recall: A programming language is a set of rules for writing computer instructions.

So we need to understand what happens when we break those rules.

Let‚Äôs take an example:

```js
const firstName = "Francesco;
const age = 33;
const nationality = "Italian";
```

On line 1, we have a variable declaration, but the string has a missing `"`. We‚Äôre not obeying the syntactic rules for JavaScript; the rules for writing expressions, statements and other parts of the language.

When we execute the code above, we get this:

const firstName = "Francesco;<br>
^^^^^^^^^^^

`Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token` <br>

We get a SyntaxError message. This error message is telling us that we‚Äôve broken the rules of the language.

üïπÔ∏è Predict, Explain

Each block of code in this activity is broken. Before you run each block of code:

1. Predict the error.
2. Explain why the error happened.

```js
const volunteer = "Shadi";
const volunteer = "Abdi";
```

```js
const volunteer = "Shadi";
volunteer = "Hinde";
```

```js
console.log(Math.round(10.3);
```

### Saving return values

We can store the return value of a function in a variable. Function calls are also expressions. This means their value can also be stored in variables, just like with operations on numbers or strings.

Suppose we have a file `arithmetic.js` containing this code:

```js
const result = Math.round(10.3);
```

When this program is executed, it creates a variable called result and assigns to it the return value of the function, in this case the rounded number.

So `result` will have a value of `10`.

### üî≠ Logging and returning

Most functions return values we can use in our program.

Math.round takes a single input, does a calculation and then returns a value that we can use when our program is running.

Some functions don‚Äôt produce useful return values in our running program; but they can still cause effects.

‚úçÔ∏è Predict, Run, Observe

```js
const result = console.log("hello world");
```

1. Predict what result will evaluate to when the code above runs.
2. Execute this line in the Node REPL.
3. Evaluate the value of the result variable to observe what happens.

When this program runs, the variable result will evaluate to undefined. undefined is a data type in JavaScript which usually means no value has been assigned. Unlike the number data type, which contains many possible values (1, 2, 10.3, etc), the undefined data type has exactly one value, undefined.

This can feel confusing as console.log is a function with a set of instructions. console.log does have an effect: it logs values to the console. However, console.log doesn‚Äôt produce an output that we can use inside the rest of our running program.

```js
üí° Tip
Key fact: console.log is used to print values to the terminal. It doesn‚Äôt produce an output in the running program.
```

## üßÆ Percentages

### Learning objectives

- [ ] Construct simple expressions to represent a calculation

Let‚Äôs begin with this problem:

Given a decimal number I want to convert it into a percentage format.

For example, given the decimal number 0.5 we return the string "50%". Given the decimal number 0.231 we return the string "23.1%".

Restating the problem
Our function must convert any decimal to a percentage. We have used functions already. Here are some functions we‚Äôve used:

```js
console.log("hello world"); // logs "hello world" to the console
Math.round(3.141); // evaluates to the whole number 3
```

All these expressions are function calls: we‚Äôre passing input ("hello world" or 3.141) to the functions (console.log or Math.round) to use their functionality. Math.round and console.log are functions that the JavaScript language designers have written and stored inside the language, because everyone needs them all the time.

No such pre-built function converts any number to a percentage, so we must write our own. We‚Äôre going to create a function called convertToPercentage with the following requirements:

Given a number input

When we call convertToPercentage with the number input

Then we get back a string representing the percentage equivalent of that number.

Here are some examples:

```js
convertToPercentage(0.5); // should return "50%"
```

```js
convertToPercentage(0.231); // should return "23.1%"
```

Useful expressions
It is often helpful to solve a problem in one specific instance before doing it for all cases.

We‚Äôre not going to define our function yet. Instead we will work out what our function should do. Then we‚Äôll define a function which does the same thing.

In programming, we always try the simplest thing first. Let‚Äôs consider how to convert just one number to a percentage. Look at this variable declaration:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;
```

We want to create an expression for the percentage using the value of decimalNumber. To convert to a percentage, we will multiply the number by 100 and then add a "%" sign on the end.

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;
const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
```

Recalling template literals, the expression in the curly braces will be evaluated first and then inserted into the string, giving us the percentage string.

### Calculate area

Now that we‚Äôve solved the problem of converting a single decimal number to a percentage, let‚Äôs practice solving other similar problems using expressions.

Create a new JavaScript file so that you can try running the code for yourself.

Calculating the area and perimeter of a rectangle
In one of these new files, let‚Äôs make two variables that describe the dimensions of a rectangle:


```js
const height = 10; // 10 is just an example of a value here - your code should still work if you change this to another value.

const width = 30; // Also just an example - your code should still work if this changes.
```

Using these variables, let‚Äôs calculate the [area](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zjbg87h/articles/zwqt6fr) and [perimeter](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zvmxsbk/articles/zmrpxbk) of the rectangle.

We can calculate the area and perimeter by creating expressions that use the height and width variables we just created. Hint: read the links above if you don‚Äôt know how to calculate area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Finally, we‚Äôll create two more variables: area and perimeter to store the result of the calculations.

```js
const area = FILL_ME_IN;
const perimeter = FILL_ME_IN;
```

Now, if we change the numbers assigned to height and width, are the area and perimeter values still correct? Try using console.log to print out the value of the variables and then run the script using Node to view the output.

## ü™Ñ Declaring functions

### Learning Objectives

- [ ] Label and describe the syntactic features of a function declaration

üí° Recall <br> Functions are reusable blocks of code.

To create a function, we can use a function declaration. A function declaration looks like this:

```js
function convertToPercentage() {}
```

The function declaration consists of the following syntactic elements:

- `function` keyword, begins the function declaration
- `convertToPercentage` - names the function
- `()` - any input to the function will go between these round braces (our function above doesn‚Äôt take any input (yet), but it still needs the `()`s)
- `{}` - the body of the function is written inside the curly braces (our function above doesn‚Äôt do anything yet, but it still needs the `{}`s)

We can create a function declaration by wrapping up the `percentage` variable and the expression for the percentage inside the function.

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
}
```

At the moment decimalNumber is not wrapped up inside the body of the function. In the following sections, we will explore what happens when this is the case.

## Playing computer

### Learning objectives

- [ ] Analyze each line in a given program and state what the line does when the program executes
- [ ] Differentiate between a function declaration and a function invocation
- [ ] Define a frame
- [ ] Describe what happens when a function is called
- [ ] Differentiate between a local frame and a global frame

To understand how `convertToPercentage` works we must build a mental model of how the computer executes our code. To build this model, we use a method called playing computer(Playing computer means simulating how the computer executes our code. We ‚Äústep through‚Äù the code, line by line, and work out what the computer does when it follows each instruction).

[We will use an interactive code visualizer to play computer.](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=const%20decimalNumber%20%3D%200.5%3B%0Afunction%20convertToPercentage%28%29%20%7B%0Aconst%20percentage%20%3D%20%60%24%7BdecimalNumber%20*%20100%7D%25%60%3B%0A%7D%0AconvertToPercentage%280.5%29%3B&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false)

Step through <br>
In a JavaScript program, each line is an instruction that will have some effect. For example, a line of code with a variable declaration means ‚Äústore a new variable with this value in memory‚Äù. In the interactive widget, arrows are used to show which line just executed and which line is next to be executed.

[Click next](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=const%20decimalNumber%20%3D%200.5%3B%0Afunction%20convertToPercentage%28%29%20%7B%0Aconst%20percentage%20%3D%20%60%24%7BdecimalNumber%20*%20100%7D%25%60%3B%0A%7D%0AconvertToPercentage%280.5%29%3B&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false) to see what happens when the computer executes the following program. Pay particular attention to what happens when the function convertToPercentage is called.

üñºÔ∏è Global frame <br>
As we step through the program, we keep track of two things: memory and the line that is being currently executed. We keep track of this information using a frame(Think of a frame as the context in which some code gets executed). <br> We use frames to keep track of memory and the line of code that is being currently executed. .

The global frame is always the first frame that gets created when our program starts executing. It is like the starting point for our program, the place where code gets executed first. When we run the code above, `decimalNumber` and `convertToPercentage` are both stored in the global frame.

üñºÔ∏è  Local frame

üí° recall <br>
A function call is an instruction to run the code inside a function

Whenever we call a function a new frame is created for executing the code inside that function. In the example above, we call the function `convertToPercentage` on line 7 and then a new frame is created for `convertToPercentage`. Inside the `convertToPercentage` frame, the computer executes the instructions inside `convertToPercentage`, storing new variables in memory and keeping track of the current line that is being executed.

## Scope

### Learning objectives

- [ ] Define scope
- [ ] Explain what happens when a variable is referenced out of scope

The function `convertToPercentage` will only be useful if we can access the `percentage` string that it creates. Otherwise, we won‚Äôt be able to use the result of `convertToPercentage` in other parts of our code. We can try accessing the `percentage` variable outside the function body like this:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
}

convertToPercentage(0.5);
console.log(percentage);
```

However if we run the code above, we get an error:

```js
ReferenceError: percentage is not defined
```

We get an error because of scope(Scope means where variables are and what you can access). <br> When we define `convertToPercentage` we also define a `local scope` - the region of code enclosed inside `convertToPercentage`‚Äôs function body. This region is `convertToPercentage`‚Äôs local scope. This means any variables we declare inside `convertToPercentage`‚Äôs local scope can only be accessed within this region. If we attempt to reference a variable outside the scope where it was declared, then get a `ReferenceError`.

## üì§ Returning from a function

## Learning objectives

- [ ] Identify the return value at a call site given its function declaration
- [ ] Log the return value of a function
- [ ] Given a short program, state the number of times a given function is called

We need a way to access the percentage string that is created inside convertToPercentage. To access values created inside functions, we write return statements(We write a return statement to specify a function‚Äôs return value. If your function call is like a question, the return value is the answer. It‚Äôs what comes back).

We can add a return statement to `convertToPercentage` like this:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}
```

If we want, we could also remove the variable `percentage`, since we can return the value of the expression directly:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  return `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
}
```

### üîé Checking the output

We can store a function‚Äôs return value in a variable.

```js
const result = Math.round(10.3);
console.log(result); // logs 10 to the console
```

We call `Math.round` which takes the input `10.3` and then returns the rounded number `10`. So `result` stores a value of `10`.

`Math.round `is a function implemented by other developers and `convertToPercentage` is a function we‚Äôre implementing, but calling `convertToPercentage` is just like calling `Math.round`.

Now we want to call the function `convertToPercentage` and store the return value in a variable.

### Store the return value

We can store the return value in a variable in exactly the same way:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}

const result = convertToPercentage(0.5);
```
### Log the return value

Log out the value of `result` to the console using `console.log`.

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}

const result = convertToPercentage(0.5);
console.log(result);
```

This will now print the following when run:

`50%`

## Reusing functions

### Learning objectives

- [ ] Evaluate a function expression
- [ ] Call a function with an input in REPL

Our goal is for `convertToPercentage` to be reusable for any number. To check this goal, let‚Äôs call `convertToPercentage` with different arguments and check the return value each time:

```js
const decimalNumber = 0.5;

function convertToPercentage() {
  const percentage = `${decimalNumber * 100}%`;
  return percentage;
}

const output1 = convertToPercentage(0.5);
const output2 = convertToPercentage(0.231);

console.log(output1);
console.log(output2);
```

When we execute this code we want to log the target output for each input: `0.5` and `0.231`:

`50%`<br>
`23.1%`<br>

However, given the function‚Äôs current implementation, we get the following logs:

`50%` <br>
`50%`

### üåç Global scope

At the moment, `decimalNumber` is in the global scope(Variables declared in the global scope are available everywhere in your program. Variables declared in a { block scope } are only available within that block. Any block within your program can access variables that are defined within the global scope). <br> Any functions we declare can reference variables in the global scope. If a variable is in the global scope, we say that variable is a global variable.
