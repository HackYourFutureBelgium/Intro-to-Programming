# Preparation
## 1. Record a goose sighting
#### Learning Objectives
- [ ] Use the automated testing tools WAVE, Accessibility Insights, and Lighthouse to identify common accessibility issues
- [ ] Record accessibility issues in a structured format
- [ ] Explain the impact of accessibility mistakes
- [ ] Suggest practical technical fixes to identified problems

### What to do  
1. Before the exercise study these materials: 
- [Introduction to WAVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITUDiTgAZY0&t=377s)
- [How to Test Web Accessibility Using the WAVE Tool: A Beginner's Guide](https://accessibly-speaking.hashnode.dev/how-to-test-web-accessibility-using-the-wave-tool-a-beginners-guide)
- [Introduction to Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
- [Understanding Lighthouse Accessibility Audit Reports](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/lighthouse-accessibility)
- [Intro to Chrome DevTools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1c5tNPpXjs)
- [Get started with viewing and changing the DOM](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/dom/)


2. Go to the [Record a goose sighting](https://record-a-goose.onrender.com/) exercise

This is a fictional service, to help you record any sightings of geese (geese are awesome). It's using the [GOV.UK Design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/), and benefits from hundreds of hours of work and testing. However, even if you're using a Design System, stuff can still go wrong...

There are places where the Design System is misused, misimplemented or misunderstood. This has caused accessibility issues, which range across code, design and content - because accessibility issues can be introduced by all of these disciplines. 

### How to use this
The task is to find as many of the accessibility issues in this site as you can in ~20 minutes.

There is a [worksheet](https://record-a-goose.onrender.com/steps/worksheet), and there is also a list of answers - but give it the full 20 minutes before you look at the [answers](https://record-a-goose.onrender.com/steps/answers) first. 


What testing tools to use
we would recommend working through the site in the following order:

- Can you access everything by pressing the tab key?
- Does WAVE show any errors, or highlight any issues with the HTML structure?
- Does the color contrast tab on WAVE throw up any errors?
- Install and run Accessibility Insights. What advice does it give you?

## 2. Interview Introductions
#### Learning Objectives
- [ ] Explain the purpose of an introduction in an interview.
- [ ] Write an introduction using the Present-Past-Future model.
  
Almost every job interview will require you to introduce yourself. This usually happens towards the beginning of the interview when the interviewer asks you a question such as “Tell me about yourself?”. Being able to answer this question effectively is a crucial employability skill. It’s your chance to sell yourself and make an amazing first impressions. Like many interview questions, this question needs to be handled in a certain way.

Your introduction should be short but not too short, ideally around 1-2 minutes.

You don’t need to give a summary of your whole CV or explain the finer details of your favorite project. It should be a sales pitch that tells the interviewer the exact things that make you perfect for this role. It can be easy to go off on a tangent when you’re nervous so make a plan and stick to it.

Being too concise is a problem too. This is an opportunity to really sell yourself. Answering this question with just a few sentences wastes that opportunity.

It’s important to match the introduction to the job. This means emphasizing the skills, experiences & interests that make you perfect for it. It is good to have a stock introduction but it will need tweaking for different jobs.

It’s also important to show your passion for the job. The IT jobs market is very competitive. Showing that you are incredibly passionate could be a unique selling point for you.

One way of structuring this is by using __the Present-Past-Future model:__

__Present:__ Start by briefly mentioning your current role or what you are doing at the moment (eduation, job, etc.). Give an overview of your responsibilities.

__Past:__ Mention your relevant experience, skills, or education. Focus on achievements and how they shaped your current professional identity.

__Future:__ Highlight what you want to do next and why you’re excited about this opportunity.

Start thinking about how you would construct an introduction for yourself. It may be useful to review some reputable external resources such as Indeed to get different perspectives and see examples.
